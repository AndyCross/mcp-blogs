## Hello

I'm Andy Cross. I've been building software for about 25 years now, and I'm still genuinely excited about the craft. I don't believe AI will kill software engineering, but it has fundamentally changed it. If we do it right, we'll make the craft better. 

These days I'm particularly interested in the intersection of AI and developer tooling—specifically how we can make LLMs genuinely useful rather than just impressive demos. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a big part of that, and you'll see a lot of posts here exploring what's possible when you give AI systems the right tools.

I'm also an entrepreneur, having founded and run tech businesses over the years. That means I occasionally write about the business side of things too—startups, product thinking, and the messy reality of turning ideas into something sustainable.

I've had a few awards in my life, which I'm thankful for but no longer maintain; Microsoft MVP and Regional Director. I do limited work in the Microsoft domain following a sale of a company I ran that was a Microsoft Partner of note. 

## What's this blog about?

Mostly Programming, MCP servers, AI tooling, and honest takes on things that could be better. I try to write about stuff I'm actually building rather than abstract theory—expect code, working examples, and candid assessments of what works and what doesn't.

## What's in the name?

I started thinking about developer tooling that brought AI and devs closer together. I wanted AIs to have the experience of DAP, setting breakpoints and stepping into functions. As of writing, this is still very hard to achieve. Hopefully one day I will have a post that covers it!
