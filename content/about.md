## Hello

I'm Andy Cross. I've been building software for about 25 years now, which is both terrifying and oddly satisfying to say out loud.

These days I'm particularly interested in the intersection of AI and developer tooling—specifically how we can make LLMs genuinely useful rather than just impressive demos. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a big part of that, and you'll see a lot of posts here exploring what's possible when you give AI systems the right tools.

## What's this blog about?

Mostly MCP servers, AI tooling, and the occasional rant about things that could be better. I try to write about stuff I'm actually building rather than abstract theory—expect code, working examples, and honest assessments of what works and what doesn't.

## Get in touch

Best way to reach me is through GitHub or X. I'm always happy to chat about this stuff.
