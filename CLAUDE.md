# Writing Style Guide

This blog is written by a human with AI assistance. The goal is writing that reads as genuinely human, not AI-generated.

## The Big Rules

### No Em Dashes

Em dashes (—) are the single biggest AI giveaway. Replace with:

- **Full stops** for dramatic pause: "It genuinely doesn't have them—no inheritance" → "It genuinely doesn't have them. No inheritance."
- **Commas** for light continuation: "building other things—learning other lessons" → "building other things, learning other lessons"
- **Parentheses** for asides: "the ones that solve this problem—native Credential Manager—are behind paywalls" → "the ones that solve this problem (native Credential Manager) are behind paywalls"
- **Colons** for introducing lists or explanations: "The server handles the tricky bit—calculating offsets" → "The server handles the tricky bit: calculating offsets"

### No Formulaic Openers

Avoid:
- "Here's the thing:"
- "Let me be clear"
- "At the end of the day"
- "Make no mistake"
- "It goes without saying"

Just make the point directly.

### No Consultant Buzzwords

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| leverage | use |
| utilize | use |
| ecosystem | system, platform, or be specific |
| holistic | complete, full |
| paradigm | (just describe it) |
| best-in-class | (state the specific capability) |
| cutting-edge | (describe what it actually does) |
| seamless | works together |
| robust | (describe the specific strength) |
| synergy | (be specific) |
| scalable | grows with you, or specify how |
| value proposition | what you get |
| transformative | (describe the actual change) |

### No Theatrical Contrasts

The "It's not X—it's Y" construction is AI catnip. Restructure to make points without contrived binary comparisons.

### No Hedged Confidence

Replace "we believe", "it's possible", "could potentially" with direct statements. If you're not sure, say so plainly.

### No Lists of Three with Escalating Drama

"Faster, smarter, better" and similar constructions read as marketing copy. Break the pattern.

## Preferred Vocabulary

Use UK-flavoured intensifiers sparingly:

- "rather" (rather excellent, rather interesting)
- "properly" (properly fast, properly confusing)  
- "remarkably" (remarkably elegant)
- "sorely" (sorely missed)
- "actually" (I actually don't miss it)

These replace overuse of "genuinely", which should appear sparingly when you really mean it.

## Voice

- First person, conversational
- Technical accuracy over marketing claims
- Concrete examples over abstract descriptions
- Acknowledge trade-offs honestly
- Self-deprecating where appropriate ("Nothing revolutionary there")
