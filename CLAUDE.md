# Writing Style Guide

This blog is written by a human with AI assistance. The goal is writing that reads as genuinely human, not AI-generated.

## The Big Rules

### No Em Dashes

Em dashes (—) are the single biggest AI giveaway. Replace with:

- **Full stops** for dramatic pause: "It genuinely doesn't have them—no inheritance" → "It genuinely doesn't have them. No inheritance."
- **Commas** for light continuation: "building other things—learning other lessons" → "building other things, learning other lessons"
- **Parentheses** for asides: "the ones that solve this problem—native Credential Manager—are behind paywalls" → "the ones that solve this problem (native Credential Manager) are behind paywalls"
- **Colons** for introducing lists or explanations: "The server handles the tricky bit—calculating offsets" → "The server handles the tricky bit: calculating offsets"

### No Formulaic Openers

Avoid:
- "Here's the thing:"
- "Let me be clear"
- "At the end of the day"
- "Make no mistake"
- "It goes without saying"

Just make the point directly.

### No Announced Observations

Don't flag the significance of what you're about to say. Phrases like "This is a remarkable position," "There is a genuine absurdity here," or "The critical insight is" are preambles that tell the reader how to feel before they've read the actual point. Just make the point. Let it land on its own.

- "This is a significant expansion. A data protection regulator is now asking..." → "A data protection regulator is now asking..."
- "There is a genuine absurdity here. You need an LLM to work out..." → "You need an LLM to work out..."
- "The critical insight is that erasure compliance needs to be designed in at training time" → "Erasure compliance needs to be designed in at training time"

If the observation is surprising, the reader will notice without being told.

### No Consultant Buzzwords

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| leverage | use |
| utilize | use |
| ecosystem | system, platform, or be specific |
| holistic | complete, full |
| paradigm | (just describe it) |
| best-in-class | (state the specific capability) |
| cutting-edge | (describe what it actually does) |
| seamless | works together |
| robust | (describe the specific strength) |
| synergy | (be specific) |
| scalable | grows with you, or specify how |
| value proposition | what you get |
| transformative | (describe the actual change) |

### No Theatrical Contrasts

The "It's not X—it's Y" construction is AI catnip. Restructure to make points without contrived binary comparisons.

### No Hedged Confidence

Replace "we believe", "it's possible", "could potentially" with direct statements. If you're not sure, say so plainly.

### No Lists of Three with Escalating Drama

"Faster, smarter, better" and similar constructions read as marketing copy. Break the pattern.

### No Colon Subtitles in Headings

Avoid "Main Title: Explanatory Subtitle" in post titles and section headings. Restructure as natural phrases instead.

- "Compliance-as-Code: Architecting for Two Europes" → "Architecting for Two Europes with Compliance-as-Code"
- "The Sovereign Inference Stack: A Practical Guide" → "A Practical Guide to the European Sovereign Inference Stack"
- "Dynamic Transparency: The Wrapper Constraint" → "Letting Users Know They're Talking to an AI"

If the subtitle adds nothing, just drop it.

## Preferred Vocabulary

Use UK-flavoured intensifiers sparingly:

- "rather" (rather excellent, rather interesting)
- "properly" (properly fast, properly confusing)  
- "remarkably" (remarkably elegant)
- "sorely" (sorely missed)
- "actually" (I actually don't miss it)

These replace overuse of "genuinely", which should appear sparingly when you really mean it.

## Voice

- First person, conversational
- Technical accuracy over marketing claims
- Concrete examples over abstract descriptions
- Acknowledge trade-offs honestly
- Self-deprecating where appropriate ("Nothing revolutionary there")
