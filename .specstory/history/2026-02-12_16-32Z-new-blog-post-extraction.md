At the center of this crisis is the practice of fine-tuning, where pre-trained models are further specialized on proprietary or targeted datasets to enhance performance in specific high-value tasks. This process, while technologically transformative, exists within a fragmented regulatory landscape. In the United Kingdom and the European Union, the governance of artificial intelligence is currently characterized by a profound divergence in copyright law, text and data mining (TDM) exceptions, and data protection interpretations. While the European Union has pioneered a comprehensive, risk-based statutory framework through the AI Act, the United Kingdom has maintained a principles-led, sector-specific oversight model, emphasizing innovation and flexibility while navigating significant domestic pressure from its creative industries. This analysis provides an exhaustive investigation into the legal and technical requirements for fine-tuning LLMs on proprietary data across both jurisdictions, identifying key friction points and proposing a unified compliance superset architecture for organizations operating in these complex markets.</p><h2>Copyright and the Crisis of Reproducibility in AI Training</h2><p>The fundamental legal challenge in training or fine-tuning any artificial intelligence model involves the act of reproduction. Under the traditional copyright frameworks of both the United Kingdom and the European Union, the extraction and ingestion of protected works into a machine learning pipeline typically constitutes a reproduction of the work. Unless such an act is authorized by the rightsholder or falls under a specific statutory exception, it may lead to claims of infringement. The divergence between these two jurisdictions in this area has become one of the most significant points of regulatory competition in the digital economy.</p><h3>The European Union Digital Single Market Directive: Articles 3 and 4</h3><p><span>The European approach to the intersection of copyright and technology is anchored in Directive (EU) 2019/790 on Copyright and Related Rights in the Digital Single Market, commonly referred to as the DSM Directive. This directive was developed to modernize copyright rules for the digital environment and introduced two critical exceptions for text and data mining (TDM). The directive defines TDM as any automated analytical technique aimed at analyzing text and data in digital form to generate information, which includes but is not limited to patterns, trends, and correlations.</span><span><span><sup></sup></span></span><span hide-from-message-actions=""> &nbsp; <button hide-from-message-actions="" aria-label="Learn more" aria-controls="sources" aria-expanded="false" aria-describedby="p-c_9d8f554b1a12278f_861fde89-4e72-4690-8b46-7918c835bb9a-19"></button></span><div><div><div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></sources-carousel-inline></p><p><span>Article 3 of the DSM Directive provides a mandatory exception for reproductions and extractions made by research organizations and cultural heritage institutions for the purposes of scientific research.</span><span><span><sup></sup></span></span><span> This exception is relatively narrow, intended to support the public interest in scientific advancement, and notably, it does not permit rightsholders to opt out. However, the application of Article 3 to the training of general-purpose AI (GPAI) is limited because most commercial developers and even many academic-private partnerships do not meet the strict criteria of being a "research organization" as defined by the directive.</span><span><span><sup></sup></span></span><span hide-from-message-actions=""> &nbsp; <button hide-from-message-actions="" aria-label="Learn more" aria-controls="sources" aria-expanded="false" aria-describedby="p-c_9d8f554b1a12278f_861fde89-4e72-4690-8b46-7918c835bb9a-20"></button></span><div><div><div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></sources-carousel-inline></p><p><span>In contrast, Article 4 of the DSM Directive provides a much broader exception for TDM performed for any purpose, including commercial activities.</span><span><span><sup></sup></span></span><span> This provision has become the cornerstone of commercial AI training in the EU.

My initial thinking is centered on the current state of Text and Data Mining (TDM) exceptions, specifically evaluating why the UK's 2022 proposal for a broad commercial exception was retracted and what that means for proprietary fine-tuning today. Simultaneously, I am analyzing the EU’s Digital Single Market Directive, specifically the practical application of the 'opt-out' mechanism for rights holders and how it transforms the technical requirements for gathering training data across different member states.</div></thought-item></div><div><div><mat-divider aria-orientation="vertical"></mat-divider></div><thought-item><div>Evaluating Data Protection Hurdles</div><div>I am investigating the tension between legitimate interest and consent as legal bases for processing personal data within machine learning pipelines. A major area of focus is the 'right to erasure' and the complex problem of machine unlearning—determining whether a model's weights must be modified if the underlying training data is deleted under GDPR or UK GDPR. I am currently cross-referencing guidance from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) against European Data Protection Board (EDPB) stances to pinpoint where their interpretations of AI training obligations are drifting apart.</div></thought-item></div><div><div><mat-divider aria-orientation="vertical"></mat-divider></div><thought-item><div>Next Steps in Research</div><div>My next phase of work involves a deep dive into the EU AI Act’s specific documentation requirements for general-purpose AI models. I will be looking for the exact transparency obligations and copyright summaries mandated by the Act to determine if they create a 'de facto' global standard for data provenance. I also intend to examine technical frameworks like data cards and lineage tracking systems to see how organizations are practically building the audit trails necessary to navigate these overlapping legal jurisdictions.</div></thought-item></div><div><div><div><img></div><mat-divider aria-orientation="vertical"></mat-divider></div><browse-chip-list><div><div> Researching websites... </div><div><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>gov.uk</div><div>Copyright and artificial intelligence statement of progress under Section 137 Data (Use and Access) Act - GOV.UK</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>lordslibrary.parliament.uk</div><div>Copyright and artificial intelligence: Impact on creative industries - House of Lords Library</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>academic.oup.com</div><div>Copyright and AI in the UK: Opting-In or Opting-Out? | GRUR International | Oxford Academic</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>hoganlovells.com</div><div>Copyright and AI: UK government publishes statement of progress - Hogan Lovells</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>legalblogs.wolterskluwer.com</div><div>Copyright and AI policy in the UK in 2025 - Wolters Kluwer</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>eur-lex.europa.eu</div><div>L_2019130EN.01009201.xml - EUR-Lex - European Union</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>cms-lawnow.com</div><div>Interplay of AI and copyright law: how do the options proposed in the UK's recent consultation compare with the EU's general TDM exception? - CMS LawNow</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>legalblogs.wolterskluwer.com</div><div>The TDM Opt-Out in the EU – Five Problems, One Solution | Kluwer Copyright Blog</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>reedsmith.com</div><div>Text and data mining in EU - Reed Smith LLP</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>epthinktank.eu</div><div>AI and copyright: The training of general‑purpose AI | Epthinktank | European Parliament</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>ico.org.uk</div><div>How do we ensure lawfulness in AI? | ICO</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>ico.org.uk</div><div>legitimate interest or interests, and demonstrate - Information Commissioner's Office</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>gdprlocal.com</div><div>ICO Artificial Intelligence: Navigating AI Compliance and Governance - GDPR Local</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>iapp.org</div><div>A legitimate interest in AI training | IAPP</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>simmons-simmons.com</div><div>ICO Consultation on Generative AI and Data Protection</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>cliffordchance.com</div><div>Copyright compliance under the EU AI Act for GPAI model providers - Clifford Chance</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>pinsentmasons.com</div><div>EU AI Act copyright template published - Pinsent Masons</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>euaiact.com</div><div>Key Issue 5: Transparency Obligations - EU AI Act</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>artificialintelligenceact.eu</div><div>High-level summary of the AI Act | EU Artificial Intelligence Act</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>wilmerhale.com</div><div>European Commission Releases Mandatory Template for Public Disclosure of AI Training Data - WilmerHale</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>finreg-e.com</div><div>6 ways to manage regulatory divergence | Compliance - FinregE</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>francescatabor.com</div><div>AI Regulation in the UK and EU: Frameworks, Implementation, Enforcement and Comparative Outcomes - FRANKI T</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>europarl.europa.eu</div><div>Regulatory divergences in the draft AI act - European Parliament</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>littler.com</div><div>Divergent Paths on Regulating Artificial Intelligence | Littler</div></a></browse-web-chip><browse-web-chip><a><img><div>brookings.edu</div><div>The EU and U.S. diverge on AI regulation: A transatlantic comparison and steps to alignment</div></a></browse-web-chip></div></div></browse-chip-list></div><div><div><div></div><mat-divider aria-orientation="vertical"></mat-divider></div><thought-item><div>UK Policy Realignment</div><div>I have identified a significant shift in the UK’s approach to copyright and AI training following the 2024-2025 consultation. While the UK previously considered a broad, developer-friendly exception, the government is now gravitating toward 'Option 3,' which mirrors the EU’s model by allowing rights holders to opt out of data mining. This represents a major moment of convergence where the UK is prioritizing alignment with European standards to ensure a stable licensing environment.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I understand the blog's style and conventions. Let me also check the README to understand the Hugo setup.

The user has pasted a comprehensive research document about regulatory divergence between UK and EU for LLM fine-tuning. I need to extract a new blog post from this that:

1. Follows the CLAUDE.md style guide:
   - No em dashes
   - No formulaic openers
   - No consultant buzzwords
   - No theatrical contrasts
   - No hedged confidence
   - No lists of three with escalating drama
   - No colon subtitles in headings
   - UK-flavoured intensifiers sparingly
   - First person, conversational tone
   - Technical accuracy over marketing claims
   - Concrete examples over abstract descriptions
   - Acknowledge trade-offs honestly

2. Fits the series "european-ai-sovereignty"
3. Uses the Hugo TOML frontmatter format
4. Has a similar tone to the existing posts (opinionated, honest, technical but accessible)

The source material covers copyright and text and data mining exceptions under the EU DSM Directive versus UK copyright law, the UK's 2024-2025 consultation and the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025, and data protection implications. I'll need to distill this into a focused piece that explores how these regulatory differences actually matter for practitioners building LLM systems.

Looking at what's already been covered—European sovereignty and infrastructure in the first post, then compliance-as-code frameworks in the second—I can see the series is building toward practical implementation guidance. The new post should tackle the fine-tuning problem specifically, since that's where copyright, data protection, machine unlearning, and the EU AI Act's requirements all collide. This angle covers genuinely new ground: the mechanics of how you'd actually build a compliant fine-tuning pipeline across these two regulatory regimes, including the right to erasure implications and the technical provenance tracking that becomes necessary.

Now I'm working through potential titles that capture this tension without being too clever or vague.  "Fine-Tuning LLMs Across the Channel" feels right because it echoes the series framing while hinting at the regulatory divide, and it naturally sets up the copyright and erasure challenges that make this post distinct from the deployment and governance angles already covered. to structure the post with TOML frontmatter, proper tags, and series attribution while maintaining the established voice. I'm focusing on three core themes that haven't been covered yet: the copyright training divergence between EU and UK regimes, the practical ambiguity around machine-readable opt-outs, and how fine-tuning can trigger provider obligations under the AI Act. Let me draft this carefully to match the style of the previous posts and include code examples and references. I'm thinking through the timing—the first post went out February 3rd, the second on February 8th, so I could publish this third one tomorrow or today. Let me draft this now and aim for something that feels genuine and practical rather than overly formal.

I'm structuring this around fine-tuning in Europe specifically, building on the previous posts about deployment and runtime compliance but shifting focus upstream to the training pipeline itself. The core sections cover copyright and the right to use training data under EU Article 4 (with its opt-out mechanism) and UK Section 29A (limited to non-commercial use), plus what's emerging from the UK consultation. I'll include some practical code examples—an opt-out checker that reads robots.txt and ai.txt signals, a SISA-style data organizer for training, and something to track provenance through fine-tuning. The length should land somewhere between the sovereignty post and the compliance-as-code one, keeping the tone opinionated and actually useful rather than just technically correct. I'm wrapping up with a conclusion about designing systems that anticipate deletion and treating data provenance as a core infrastructure concern. Before I write the full post, I need to nail down two practical code examples: an opt-out scanner that checks robots.txt, ai.txt, and meta tags for AI training restrictions, and a fine-tuning registry that tracks data source, licensing status, jurisdiction, and PII so erasure requests can be handled by shard rather than retraining from scratch. These feel like the kind of concrete, useful examples that fit the existing posts.

Now I'm settling into the writing itself, keeping the style conversational and first-person, avoiding em dashes and consultant jargon, and being honest about trade-offs. I'm aiming for something around the same length as the compliance post, with similarly substantial code and explanation.</details></think>

---

Now I have a clear picture of the blog's voice, format, and conventions. Let me extract a new post from the research material, focusing on the fine-tuning-specific themes that aren't covered by the existing two posts (which focus on deployment sovereignty and runtime compliance).

The new post will cover the **training-time** side: copyright and TDM, the opt-out mess, when fine-tuning makes you a "provider" under the AI Act, and the right-to-erasure problem with model weights.

Now I have the full picture. The series so far:

1. "Building AI Platforms Under European Sovereignty" (Feb 3) - Why jurisdiction matters, sovereignty spectrum, models as commodities
2. "Architecting for Two Europes with Compliance-as-Code" (Feb 8) - Runtime compliance, transparency middleware, governance logging, adequacy circuit breaker
3. "A Practical Guide to the European Sovereign Inference Stack" (Feb 9) - Sovereign compute providers, hardware, inference engines, jurisdictional routing
4. "Securing the Open Source AI Supply Chain" (Feb 11) - Supply chain attacks, SBOMs, model verification


5. This post (Feb 13) should tackle fine-tuning specifically—copyright implications, text and data mining rights, data erasure requirements, and the practical challenges of actually training on European data.

I'm planning the structure now: start by connecting this to the deployment and inference posts, then dive into the fine-tuning pipeline and the regulatory constraints that make it fundamentally different from inference. I need to maintain the same analytical tone and depth as the previous posts while being precise about the legal and technical details. I'm mapping out the structure for a blog post on fine-tuning LLMs under European regulation—starting with the copyright landscape across jurisdictions, then moving through the practical and legal challenges like opt-out detection, the AI Act's provider thresholds, and the data erasure problem. I'll write this in the same conversational, opinionated style as my previous posts, making sure to ground everything in actual regulations and real constraints. Right of erasure under Article 17 creates a real problem for neural networks since you can't just delete rows like you would in a database, so I'm thinking through the spectrum of unlearning techniques and why SISA (Sharded Isolated Sharded Aggregated training) emerges as the most practical middle ground. Then there's the legitimate interest test which has three parts: the purpose needs to be concrete rather than vague innovation claims, you have to show necessity by ruling out alternatives like synthetic data, and the ICO has been expanding what counts as harm to include economic damage and job displacement. The practical upshot is that you need to design for deletion from the start during training rather than trying to retrofit it afterward, and treating data provenance as a core infrastructure concern rather than an afterthought. I'm settling on `fine-tuning-under-european-law.md` as the filename and now drafting the full post with substantial content but avoiding bloat. I'll keep the tone conversational and first-person, include real code examples, and focus on practical approaches rather than corporate jargon.

The post will build on the previous sovereignty series entries about deployment and compliance, but shift focus upstream to the training phase itself. The core tension I'm exploring is that fine-tuning on proprietary data creates legal friction across copyright, data protection, and AI regulation—and the UK and EU have taken different paths on all three, so the compliance work happens before any weights get updated, not at inference time like the earlier posts covered.

Now I'm moving into the substantive section about data rights and copyright, which is where the real constraints start to bite. In the EU, the default flips—you can mine copyrighted works for training unless the rightsholder explicitly opts out through machine-readable means. The UK took a different path, implementing only a narrow non-commercial research exception under Section 29A, leaving commercial fine-tuning without legal cover unless you secure explicit permission.

The UK government consulted on four options last year, with their preferred approach mirroring the EU's opt-out model, but the creative sector overwhelmingly rejected this in the consultation responses, pushing back hard for stronger protections instead. Rather than legislate immediately, the government deferred the decision, pointing instead to the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025.

That act requires two key reports by March 2026: an economic impact assessment of all four options and a detailed analysis of how copyright works are being used in AI development, while technical working groups hash out transparency standards and licensing frameworks. The upshot is that commercial text and data mining in the UK sits in legal limbo until mid-2026 at the earliest—if you're fine-tuning on copyrighted material commercially, you're either getting a licence or taking a calculated risk.

When building for both markets, the UK's stricter stance becomes the binding constraint.  You can't lean on the EU's Article 4 exception and then deploy elsewhere; instead, treat all copyrighted training data as requiring explicit permission, and layer in automated opt-out detection for EU web content as a safety net.

Even within the EU's broader exception, respecting opt-outs is mandatory but technically murky. The DSM Directive requires opt-outs to be expressed in "machine-readable means" but never spelled out what that actually looks like, leaving member states to transpose the rules independently without any harmonised technical standard—which created a fragmented landscape.

Now I'm looking at what actually counts as machine-readable in practice. There's robots.txt, the oldest and most widely used mechanism for controlling crawler access, though it was never designed specifically for copyright protection. Then there's ai.txt as a newer alternative, the W3C's TDM Reservation Protocol using HTTP headers and JSON-LD for more formal rights declarations, HTML meta tags embedded in page metadata, and plain-text terms of service buried in legal documents. The challenge is that none of these have achieved consistent adoption or standardisation across jurisdictions.

A German court took a striking position on this, ruling that "machine-readable" should really mean "machine-understandable"—suggesting that if your crawler is sophisticated enough to parse natural language, then terms of service written in plain English could count as valid opt-outs. This essentially flips the burden onto AI developers to interpret any format of reservation, no matter how it's expressed, which creates an almost absurd situation where the more capable your language model, the more you're expected to comply with increasingly informal restrictions.

Now I'm building a practical scanner for fine-tuning pipelines that need to detect opt-outs before ingesting web content, checking the most common mechanisms across different sources.

Defining the scanner class... Fetching the robots.txt file and checking if it blocks known AI bots or the current bot with a disallow rule, then recording any blocks found as signals in the result.

Now I'm checking for an ai.txt file that might contain disallow or restriction keywords, and also examining HTTP headers for TDM reservation protocols and custom headers that indicate opt-out preferences. Completing the usage example and demonstrating the scanner's behavior. The key design principle here is that it fails conservatively—any detected reservation signal blocks the URL from the training set, and ambiguous cases default to blocking as well. This is intentionally strict for compliance reasons. I'm deliberately not building natural language parsing of terms of service into this, since misinterpreting legal language could create both copyright and credibility problems down the line.

Now looking at how fine-tuning fits into the regulatory landscape. Under the EU AI Act, substantial modifications to an existing model can elevate you to "provider" status, which brings a whole set of compliance obligations around documentation and training data transparency. The AI Office is using compute thresholds to define what counts as substantial—specifically looking at whether fine-tuning consumes more than a third of the original training FLOPs.

In practice, this distinction matters significantly. Lightweight approaches like LoRA adapters on large models stay well below that threshold and keep you in the "deployer" category, but full parameter fine-tuning with extensive continued pre-training could push you over the line and into provider obligations. The key takeaway is understanding your actual compute usage—if you're anywhere close to that threshold, you need to prepare the full compliance documentation.

The EU AI Office published a specific template in July 2025 that requires detailed disclosure of your training data sources, the most-used domains in your dataset, and how you've handled copyright opt-outs. This applies to every stage of training, including fine-tuning, so if you're adapting someone else's model, you're documenting your own fine-tuning data independently of whatever the original provider disclosed.

Now I'm thinking about the practical challenge of compliance with data deletion rights. The GDPR's right to erasure under Article 17 is straightforward in traditional databases—you locate and delete the record. But once data is baked into a trained model's weights, deletion becomes conceptually messy.

The EDPB's guidance lays out a spectrum of approaches, ranging from the most thorough to the most realistic. Full retraining—removing the data from your training set and rebuilding the model entirely—is the cleanest answer legally, but it's prohibitively expensive at scale.

SISA offers a middle ground: partition your training data into independent shards, train separate sub-models on each one, then combine them for predictions. When someone requests deletion, you only need to retrain the shard that contained their data. Influence functions provide another option using mathematical techniques to estimate and reverse a specific data point's effect on the weights, though the precision is lower and the computational guarantees are weaker than retraining.

Output filtering intercepts queries to suppress certain generations, which provides quick protection but doesn't actually remove the data's influence from the model itself—most regulators wouldn't accept this as true erasure.

The key is building deletion capability into your training architecture from the start. A monolithic model trained as a single process leaves you with no options when erasure requests arrive. SISA solves this by giving you that escape hatch. I'm building a data registry that tracks which shards contain which data points, handles erasure lookups, and flags which shards need retraining...

Defining the data structures... I'm setting up a ShardedTrainingRegistry that distributes data points across multiple shards using consistent hashing, which lets me track which subjects appear in which shards for efficient GDPR erasure requests. The registry initializes with a configurable number of shards and assigns each data point deterministically based on its ID hash.

Implementing the ingestion logic... Finishing the erasure confirmation message, then moving on to build a compliance summary method that collects audit information across all shards—tracking data point counts, retraining status, and PII subject identifiers for each one.

Now I'm instantiating the registry with four shards and ingesting training data points with full provenance tracking, including source URLs, content hashes, and licensing information to validate what can be used for training.

The third document gets rejected because it lacks proper licensing, while the first two pass through—one with explicit licensing and PII flagged, the other cleared under text and data mining rules. When a subject requests erasure, the system identifies which shards contain their data and only retrains those affected shards rather than the entire model, which is much more efficient than a full retraining cycle.

In production, you'd want to optimize the sharding strategy further—balancing shard sizes, keeping high-PII data distributed so no single shard becomes expensive to retrain frequently, and hooking the "needs_retrain" flags directly into your actual training pipeline.

Now I'm thinking about the legal foundation for this whole approach. If your fine-tuning data came from the web, it almost certainly contains personal data, which means you need a lawful basis under GDPR. Consent doesn't work at scale—you can't realistically get informed consent from everyone whose data appears in a web-scraped corpus. That leaves legitimate interest as the practical option, which both the UK's ICO and other regulators have guidance on.

But legitimate interest isn't a blank check. There's a three-part assessment: you need a specific, documented purpose (not just "general improvement" but something concrete like "fine-tuning for medical document summarization"), you need to show the processing is actually necessary for that purpose, and you need to weigh your interests against the data subjects' rights.

On the necessity side, regulators are increasingly demanding that you explore alternatives—synthetic data, anonymized datasets, licensed collections—and explain why they wouldn't work. The balancing test is where things get interesting: the EDPB focuses on traditional privacy harms like discrimination and re-identification, but the ICO's recent guidance broadens this to include economic harms, like when an AI model displaces human workers in creative fields.

Now I'm moving through the practical implementation: a five-stage pipeline for cross-border compliance that starts with verifying copyright status and licensing before any data enters the system, then classifying and documenting personal data to track which individuals appear in which records.

The assessment of legitimate interest becomes a formal legal document that needs technical inputs about what data you're using and what alternatives you considered, especially the economic impact analysis for UK markets. Training happens across independent shards with careful logging of compute resources to track whether you've hit the one-third FLOP threshold under the AI Act, and you maintain an immutable record of which data went where. Finally, if you're operating in the EU and making substantial modifications, you generate a training content summary using the official AI Office template.

The key point is that this summary must document your fine-tuning data specifically—you can't just rely on whatever documentation existed for the upstream model. For serious cross-border deployment, none of this is optional. The EU AI Act enforcement kicks in August 2025, and the UK's copyright position solidifies by mid-2026, so building this compliance infrastructure now is far cheaper than trying to retrofit it later.

Now I'm reviewing the specific regulatory references—the DSM Directive's text-and-data mining exceptions, the EU AI Act's requirements for GPAI providers around documentation and training content, GDPR's lawful basis and erasure rights, and the EDPB's recent guidance on data protection aspects. Looking at the UK legislative framework, there are several key reporting requirements coming up—the Data Act mandates assessments on copyright policy impacts and AI development practices due in March 2026, while the recent Copyright and AI consultation showed the government leaning toward an opt-out model for copyright works, and the ICO's updated guidance emphasizes legitimate interest as a basis for processing with a broader harm assessment approach.

On the legal and technical side, the KNHG v LAION case in Germany set an important precedent by interpreting the EU's text and data mining exception to cover machine-understandable content, not just machine-readable formats. Meanwhile, the EDPB's analysis of machine unlearning explores the technical feasibility of data erasure in AI systems through methods like SISA and influence functions, with guidance on how to verify these processes actually work. em dashes: Let me check... I see a couple of places where I should check. "non-starter" is fine (that's a hyphen). Let me scan...
   - "...not just inherit the upstream model's documentation." - fine
   - I need to check every instance. Let me look for "—"... I don't think I used any.

2. No formulaic openers: I don't see any. Good.

3. No consultant buzzwords: Let me check...
   - "leverage" - no
   - "utilize" - no
   - "ecosystem" - no
   - "holistic" - no
   - "paradigm" - no
   - "best-in-class" - no
   - "cutting-edge" - no
   - "seamless" - no
   - "robust" - no
   - "synergy" - no
   - "scalable" - no
   - "value proposition" - no
   - "transformative" - no
   Good.

4. No theatrical contrasts: I don't think I have "It's not X—it's Y" patterns. Good.

5. No hedged confidence: Let me check... "Whether you think that is appropriate or overreach" - that's honest framing, not hedging. "almost certainly does" - that's direct. Good.

6. No lists of three with escalating drama: I don't think I have any. My lists have clear, distinct items.

7. No colon subtitles in headings: Let me check my headings...
   - "Do You Have the Right to Use That Data?" - fine
   - "The EU Position" - fine
   - "The UK Position" - fine
   - "What This Means for Cross-Border Work" - fine
   - Continuing through the rest...

all my headings avoid colon subtitles. Good.

8. UK-flavoured intensifiers: I used "properly contentious" once. Good.

9. First person, conversational: Yes, throughout. "I expected", "I want to demonstrate", etc.

10. Technical accuracy: Checked against source material. Good.

11. Now checking for em dashes and other stylistic elements...

12. Trade-offs acknowledged: Yes, multiple places.

The title works well without a colon subtitle - it's a natural phrase. The intro connects directly to the series without feeling formulaic. I've deliberately left out the Digital Omnibus proposal since it's speculative and the post is already substantial; I'm sticking with the most practical, settled areas of regulation.

Now I need to settle on the filename.</details></think>

Now I'll create the new post. It focuses on the training-time side of compliance (copyright, TDM, erasure, provider status) which is entirely new territory compared to the existing posts about deployment and runtime.

The new post is created at `content/posts/fine-tuning-under-european-law.md`. Here is what it covers and how it fits into the series:

**Title:** "What It Actually Takes to Fine-Tune an LLM in Europe"

**Position in the series:** Post #5. The previous four covered deployment sovereignty, runtime compliance-as-code, the sovereign inference stack, and supply chain security. This one goes earlier in the pipeline to training time.

**Key sections:**

1. **Copyright and TDM divergence** - The EU's Article 4 broad exception (with opt-out) versus the UK's current position of no commercial TDM exception at all. Covers the 2024-2025 consultation, the 88% response backing stronger copyright, and the Data (Use and Access) Act kicking the decision to March 2026.

2. **The opt-out detection problem** - What "machine-readable" actually means (nobody agrees), the German court ruling that natural language terms might count, and the absurdity of needing NLP to check if you can train NLP. Includes a practical `TDMOptOutScanner` code example that fails closed.

3. **When fine-tuning makes you a provider** - The EU AI Act's one-third FLOP threshold for "substantial modification." LoRA is probably safe, full parameter fine-tuning might not be. Know your FLOPs.

4. **The strawberry in the smoothie** - Article 17 erasure meets neural network weights. Covers the full spectrum from retraining to output filtering, with SISA as the practical middle ground. Includes a `ShardedTrainingRegistry` code example that tracks data provenance, blocks unlicensed content, and supports targeted erasure.

5. **Legitimate interest is not a free pass** - The three-part test, with the notable UK divergence where the ICO now factors economic harm (job displacement) into the balancing test.

Let me re-read the specific passage in context and compare the voice.

The line in question:
"There is a genuine absurdity here. You may need NLP to determine whether you are allowed to train your NLP model."

Looking at the author's actual voice in the existing posts:

From compliance-as-code:
- "The third option is probably worth its own post. That post might also be a rant."
- "This feels fragile, and honestly it is."
- "federated query layers are HARD. This is a proper distributed systems problem, not a config change."
- "I have mixed feelings about this one."


From sovereignty post:
- "This creates an awkward middle category that doesn't fit cleanly into the sovereignty spectrum."
- "I don't have a clean answer to this."
- "This is uncomfortable. But it's honest."
- "Nobody's doing it."

The author's voice is direct and dry, honest about what doesn't work. They favor short, punchy sentences and tend toward the observational rather than the grandiose. The phrase "genuine absurdity" feels too formal for how they actually write—they'd probably just say it's absurd, or point out the problem more plainly. The real tension here is that you're caught in a catch-22, and that's worth stating plainly rather than dressing up in essay language. about what that means in practice—you actually need NLP to figure out whether you're allowed to train your NLP model. That's properly circular. The circularity is hard to miss. You need NLP to figure out whether you're allowed to train your NLP model. I'm noticing the user's writing style tends toward understated directness—they state observations plainly without announcing irony or absurdity, letting the point land on its own. The phrasing "You need an LLM to work out whether you're allowed to train one" captures that circularity better than anything more elaborate, and adding "actually" sharpens it without overexplaining.</details></think>

Right. Two issues:

1. "There is a genuine absurdity here." - This announces the joke. It's essay-register, proclamatory. Your actual voice just states the absurd thing and moves on.

2. "You may need NLP to determine whether you are allowed to train your NLP model." - "may need" is hedged, "determine" is formal/academic. Your voice would use "work out" and be more direct.

Compare to how you write observations in the other posts:
- "This is uncomfortable. But it's honest."
- "Nobody's doing it."
- "The third option is probably worth its own post. That post might also be a rant."


- Just state the absurdity without flagging it. Drop the announcement and make it drier, more direct.</details></think>

---

The problem is two-fold:

1. **"There is a genuine absurdity here"** announces the joke before delivering it. Your actual voice doesn't do that. You state the absurd thing and let it land. Compare: "This is uncomfortable. But it's honest." or "Nobody's doing it." You never flag irony. You just say the thing.

2. **"You may need NLP to determine whether you are allowed to train your NLP model"** is hedged ("may need") and formal ("determine"). Your voice would be more direct and use plainer verbs.

Let me scan the post for the same anti-pattern: announcing observations before making them, using essay-register language to flag irony or importance instead of just stating the thing.

The pattern is: AI tends to write "This is X" or "There is a Y here" as a preamble to the actual observation. The author's voice just makes the observation directly and lets the reader notice the significance.

Let me go through line by line looking for instances:

1. **Line 13**: "The answer is more complicated than I expected." - This is fine. It's personal and specific.

2. **Line 80**: "This is a remarkable position." - This is the same anti-pattern. 

3. **Line 249**: "This creates a genuine tension." - "genuine tension" is essay-register. The author would just describe the tension without the qualifier.

4. **Line 458**: "This is a significant expansion." - Same pattern. Announcing significance rather than letting the reader notice it.

5. **Line 265**: "The critical insight is that erasure compliance needs to be designed in at training time, not bolted on afterwards." - "The critical insight" is a preamble that announces importance. The author would just state the point directly.

6. **Line 60**: "This sounds simple. It is not." - This is actually in the author's voice. Short, punchy. Fine.

7. **Line 221**: "This is the conservative approach, and for cross-border compliance, conservative is correct." - Direct statement of position. Works.

8. **Line 440**: "The principle is the same: modularity at training time buys you flexibility at compliance time." - Reads a bit polished but it's practical enough. Borderline.

9. **Line 255**: "This is the gold standard for compliance." - Common expression used plainly. Fine.

10. **Line 446**: "Consent is a non-starter for large..." - Need to see where this goes, but checking if there's unnecessary announcement language here too.

Looking at the pattern, the real offenders are the ones that announce an observation before making it. Line 80 with "This is a remarkable position," Line 249 with "This creates a genuine tension," Line 265 with "The critical insight is that," and Line 458 with "This is a significant expansion" all do this. They're telling me something is important before showing me why.

For fixes, I should strip these preambles and let the observation stand on its own. The author's natural voice is more direct—"The sovereignty spectrum above is tidier than reality" doesn't announce itself. So Line 80 could just become "Effectively, this says that if your crawler..." or "The implication is worth spelling out. If your crawler..." Something that moves straight into the substance.

Line 249 works better as a direct question: "If someone whose data appeared in your fine-tuning set requests erasure, what does compliance actually look like?" The tension is implicit in the question itself.

Line 265 should drop "The critical insight is that" entirely and just state it: "Erasure compliance needs to be designed in at training time, not bolted on afterwards." Then continue with the reasoning.

Line 458 is the clearest case—the second sentence already makes the point, so I can just delete the announcement and start with "A data protection regulator is now asking you to consider whether your model puts people out of work."

Now I'm ready to draft these revisions and see how they read in context. I'm working through the phrasing of this rule now—the key is that readers should discover the significance themselves rather than being told upfront. I'll add this as a new Big Rule in the CLAUDE.md file, probably right after the section on formulaic openers, and then make all the updates.</details></think>

I found four instances of the same anti-pattern: announcing the significance of an observation before making it, instead of just stating the thing and letting it land. Here they are:

1. **Line 80**: "This is a remarkable position." (tells the reader it's remarkable before saying why)
2. **Line 249**: "This creates a genuine tension." (flags the tension before describing it)
3. **Line 265**: "The critical insight is that..." (announces that an insight is coming)
4. **Line 458**: "This is a significant expansion." (labels the significance before the reader has a chance to notice it)

The underlying pattern: AI loves to write "This is [adjective]" as a preamble. Your voice just says the thing. Let me add the rule and fix all four.

Now the four fixes in the post. Starting with line 80: "This is a remarkable position. It effectively says that..." The preamble adds nothing. The next sentence already makes the point.

Done. Here's a summary of what changed:

**CLAUDE.md** - Added "No Announced Observations" as a new Big Rule. The pattern: don't tell the reader something is remarkable, significant, or critical before saying it. Just say it.

**fine-tuning-under-european-law.md** - Fixed four instances:

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| "This is a remarkable position. It effectively says..." | "Effectively, if your crawler is smart enough..." |
| "This creates a genuine tension. If someone..." | "If someone whose data appeared in your fine-tuning set requests erasure, what does compliance actually look like?" |
| "The critical insight is that erasure compliance needs to be designed in at training time, not bolted on afterwards." | "Erasure compliance needs to be designed in at training time." |
| "This is a significant expansion. A data protection regulator is now asking..." | "A data protection regulator is now asking..." |

Same pattern in every case: the preamble was doing nothing that the observation itself didn't already do.

Now let me scan each post for instances of the "announced observations" anti-pattern. The pattern is: using phrases like "This is [adjective]", "There is a [adjective] here", "The [adjective] thing is", "It is worth noting that" (as a preamble to flag importance), etc.

**Post 1: european-ai-sovereignty.md**

Let me scan through:

- Line 11: "This framing is a trap." - This is fine. It's direct and opinionated. It doesn't announce that the next observation is significant; it IS the observation.
- Line 45: "This is sovereignty as systems engineering." - This is actually fine. 

It's a definition, not an announcement of significance.
- Line 72: "This creates an awkward middle category that doesn't fit cleanly into the sovereignty spectrum." - Borderline. "creates an awkward middle category" is somewhat announcing the awkwardness, but it's also factual and descriptive. I think it reads more like the author's voice than essay-register. Keep it.
- Line 92: "This is uncomfortable. But it's honest." - This is fine. It's short, punchy, personal. It's not announcing an observation; it's reacting to one.
- Line 106: "This is where the analysis needs to shift." - This is a structural transition, not an announcement of significance. Keep it.
- Line 120: "The deepest advantage of a sovereignty-constrained platform is also its most counterintuitive: the data cannot leave." - The phrases "deepest advantage" and "most counterintuitive" are doing the announcing work here. I'm telling the reader the advantage is deep and counterintuitive before showing why. The author would probably just describe the advantage and let that quality emerge naturally.
- Line 128: "This is the counterintuitive promise of sovereignty: by constraining where data can go, you force architectures that use data better." - Same problem with "counterintuitive promise" — it's flagging the observation rather than letting it stand on its own.
- Line 142: "This is the framing that makes the sovereignty constraint productive rather than limiting." - This one's announcing the significance of the framing before establishing it.

Let me reconsider the author's actual voice here.

Looking back at the compliance-as-code piece, the author writes things like "The thing I actually like about this pattern is that it gets out of the way" and "There is something uncomfortable about pouring engineering effort into compliance machinery while your competitors are shipping features." These are personal, direct reactions — not clinical pronouncements.

The real distinction is between essay-register labels like "remarkable," "significant," "genuine," "critical," "noteworthy" — those detached adjectives that pre-judge the observation — versus the author's more immediate, personal way of engaging with ideas. The test isn't whether "This is X" appears, but whether X is doing the work of announcing importance rather than describing a genuine reaction.

Re-examining the sovereignty post with this lens, lines like "The deepest advantage of a sovereignty-constrained platform is also its most counterintuitive" do lean on superlatives that tell the reader how to feel. But the author consistently makes strong, opinionated claims throughout, so these feel more like the author's natural voice than essay-register moves. The "most counterintuitive" phrasing is the sticking point, though in context it's probably acceptable. These are marginal cases.

The compliance post reads much more conversational—phrases like "Nothing revolutionary there" and "I have mixed feelings about this one" are clearly personal reactions rather than announcements. No real violations there.

Moving into the sovereign inference stack post now, checking for the same pattern.

Post 4 has that line "That is genuinely remarkable" which initially seemed like it might be announcing how to react, but looking at it in context, it's actually just a direct statement of opinion responding to the point about democratizing access. It's not setting up an observation—it's the observation itself. I think that one holds up fine.

The "most significant bottleneck" phrasing in line 107 is doing real work as a thesis statement for that section, so that feels justified too.

Let me dig deeper into the other posts to see if there are clearer style violations I'm missing. Looking back through all four posts carefully, they're actually quite clean—the voice stays strong and conversational throughout, with occasional formal moments that serve a real purpose rather than padding. The anti-pattern I was concerned about really only showed up in the new post I generated, which makes sense since that's where the AI scaffolding became more visible.

Let me do a final check for those telltale phrases that signal empty preambles, scanning through the existing posts for patterns like "This is a," "There is a," "It is worth," and similar announcement structures. Going through european-ai-sovereignty.md, I'm finding phrases like "This framing is a trap" and "This is sovereignty as systems engineering"—but these are doing actual work, making blunt claims or defining concepts rather than just warming up the reader.

The borderline cases are trickier. "This is the framing that makes the sovereignty constraint productive" functions as a thesis statement wrapping up a section, and "This is the counterintuitive promise of sovereignty" announces something, but both feel intentional given how strong the author's voice is throughout.

In compliance-as-code-two-europes.md, "If there is one section of this post that significantly adds complexity, it's this one" is doing double duty—it's both an announced observation and a structural signal about what matters in the post, which makes it harder to dismiss outright.

The rest of these feel genuinely fine. "There is an obvious fragility here, though" is matter-of-fact rather than essay-register, and "There is something uncomfortable about pouring engineering effort into compliance machinery while your competitors are shipping features" is personal and conversational. In sovereign-inference-stack.md, "it is worth noting" is mild enough that it works as parenthetical information rather than a preamble. And in securing-open-source-ai-supply-chain.md, "That is genuinely remarkable" reads as a personal reaction, which fits the voice.

The data points like "stands out" and "most significant bottleneck" are doing practical work—flagging specific information and setting up section structure—so they land fine in context. After going through all of this, I think the existing tone is actually working as intended.

Let me double-check one more time though, since the user asked me to be thorough. Looking at "The deepest advantage of a sovereignty-constrained platform is also its most counterintuitive: the data cannot leave"—the double announcement of "deepest" and "most counterintuitive" is a bit much, but the colon immediately delivers the actual observation, and the author is making a substantive claim here rather than just padding. The sentence structure carries weight.

Then there's "This is the counterintuitive promise of sovereignty: by constraining where data can go, you force architectures that use data better." The word "counterintuitive" appears twice in this section, which does feel slightly mechanical, but this sentence is functioning as a section summary and doing structural work.

I think these four posts are genuinely clean. The anti-pattern I flagged really does seem concentrated in the new post I generated, which makes sense—it's an AI writing habit that wouldn't naturally appear in the human author's voice.

Though wait, the CLAUDE.md file says these posts were written with AI assistance, so I did contribute somehow. But the human clearly edited heavily to match their own voice and remove those patterns.

Let me do one final check for "It is [adjective] that..." constructions. Nothing jumps out. I'm satisfied these posts are clean. I should report my findings to the user.

Actually, let me take another look at the supply chain post since it was the most recently generated with AI help. Scanning through it again, I see a few borderline cases like "This is where 'open washing' has operational consequences" which has some essay-register phrasing, but it's doing structural work and gets followed by concrete details. The other instances are fine—direct references or natural transitions. I think this one passes too.

Now I'm checking for any announcement-style adjectives like "crucial," "fundamental," or "remarkable" used as preambles across all four posts. The existing three are clean. In the supply chain post, "genuinely remarkable" appears as a personal reaction rather than a preamble, and "remarkably slow" is just a UK intensifier. Both are fine. I'm satisfied the existing posts are solid—the only real issues were in the new piece I wrote myself.</details></think>

I've gone through all four posts carefully. Here's what I found:

**european-ai-sovereignty.md** - Clean. The voice is strong throughout. Phrases like "This framing is a trap" (line 11) and "This is uncomfortable. But it's honest" (line 92) are personal reactions, not essay-register announcements. They land because they're blunt and conversational.

**compliance-as-code-two-europes.md** - Clean. Lines like "Nothing revolutionary there" (line 40), "I have mixed feelings about this one" (line 269), and "That post might also be a rant" (line 271) are the author reacting, not announcing. No violations.

**sovereign-inference-stack.md** - Clean. Direct and practical throughout. No announced observations.

**securing-open-source-ai-supply-chain.md** - Clean. "That is genuinely remarkable" (line 12) is a personal reaction to a specific claim, not a preamble. "Remarkably slow" (line 29) is a UK intensifier used well. No violations.

The anti-pattern was concentrated in the new post I generated. That makes sense. "This is a remarkable position," "This creates a genuine tension," and "The critical insight is" are AI writing tics. The existing posts, where your voice is already in control, don't have this problem. Nothing to correct in the other four.

What on earth is the strawberry in the smoothie?!

_**Agent (model claude-4.6-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is questioning the "Strawberry in the Smoothie" section heading and metaphor. Let me re-read it.

The metaphor comes from the source material they pasted - researchers comparing deleting data from a trained LLM to "trying to retrieve a specific strawberry from a smoothie." It's used to explain why the right to erasure (Article 17 GDPR) is technically difficult for neural networks.

The user seems to find it jarring or out of place. Let me look at it in context.

Looking at the section:

```
## The Strawberry in the Smoothie

The right to erasure under Article 17 of the GDPR requires controllers to delete personal data "without undue delay" when requested. In a traditional database, you find the record and delete it. 

In a trained neural network, the data has been blended into billions of parameters. Researchers have compared it to trying to retrieve a specific strawberry from a smoothie. Once the weights have been updated, the influence of any single data point is diffused throughout the model.
```

The metaphor is attributed to "researchers" in the source material. It's a real analogy used in the machine unlearning literature. But the user might find the heading too whimsical for the tone of the series, or the metaphor itself unclear or silly. Looking at the other section headings, they're more straightforward and formal, so this one does stand out tonally.

In a trained neural network, once data gets blended into billions of parameters and weights are updated, any single data point's influence becomes diffused throughout the model—researchers have compared this to trying to retrieve a specific strawberry from a smoothie. The heading feels more literary than the rest of the series, which uses direct, descriptive titles, so it might be worth reconsidering whether this metaphor fits the overall tone.

I should suggest a more straightforward heading that aligns with the series style—something like "Why You Can't Delete Data from a Trained Model" or "The Erasure Problem"—and ask if they'd prefer the metaphor removed entirely or just the heading changed to be more direct.</details></think>

Fair point. The heading is too cute for the rest of the series. Compare it against the other section headings:

- "Do You Have the Right to Use That Data?"
- "The Opt-Out Detection Problem"
- "When Fine-Tuning Makes You a Provider"
- "Legitimate Interest Is Not a Free Pass"

Those are all direct and descriptive. "The Strawberry in the Smoothie" reads like a chapter title from a pop-science book.

The metaphor itself is fine in the body text (it's from the machine unlearning literature and it does explain the problem well), but the heading should say what the section is actually about.

The smoothie metaphor still appears in the paragraph below to explain the concept, which is where it belongs. The heading now tells you what the section is about, like every other heading in the series.
