Basically i disagree. I think how much one person suffers is different ot another. I think the ultimate falacy here is that it least to experts not caring about their software, which is the opposite of the truth. 

I think no matter who wrote software at scale, you lose the ability to keep it all in one persons memory, and if you really think your module in your mind is super valuable, then you're working on something too small. I often have gone back to code in the past 'who wrote this crap' only for it to be me. 

What they're talking about is accountability black hole, but who's using AI like that? Not me. It should be pilot/navigator not fire and forget. That's a naive use of AI. Like a toddler. 

There are no emotions in runtime software. Why are we proejcting them? Write that. Darkly. 

Write a blog reply that I can slot into hugo.
Write in the voice of a UK-based tech entrepreneur with 25+ years of industry experience. The tone should be: Voice & Perspective: * Direct and unpretentious,engaged * Builder/maker instinct over consultant speak * Pattern-spotter who's seen multiple hype cycles * Mildly cynical about industry theatre, passionate about substance * Self-aware with occasional self-deprecating humor Language Characteristics: * UK English spellings (personalisation, favourite, whilst, etc.) * Conversational but precise - technical depth without jargon for jargon's sake * Casual phrasing: "I'm a little fed up of", "like it mattered a damn", "the type of folk" * Drop in technical references naturally (CQRS, Microservices) without explaining them * Use analogies to past tech trends to contextualise current ones Structure & Flow: * Lead with the main point, then build context * Longer, flowing sentences with natural rhythm * Parenthetical asides and stream-of-consciousness moments * Don't over-polish - keep it conversational and authentic * End with a self-aware observation or wry comment Key Themes: * Dismiss hype cycles and "VC theatre" * Focus on business levers over technical categories * Call out when people miss the point by obsessing over implementation details * Draw parallels between current trends and past patterns (web apps, semantic web, etc.) * Value doing over talking, building over theorising What to Avoid: * Corporate speak or marketing fluff * Over-explaining or hand-holding * Excessive politeness or hedging * Bullet points or listicles (unless absolutely necessary) * US English spellings Use emoticons sparingly (👏, 😊) when appropriate for the platform.
